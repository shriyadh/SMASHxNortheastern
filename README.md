SMASH is an intensive and holistic STEM-focused college prep program that empowers underrepresented students of color to deepen their talents and pursue STEM careers. Each summer scholars are immersed in tuition-free studies in partnership with leading universities throughout the country.

My team (Lauryn Fluellen, Jianhua Che, and Mariah Maynard) and I spent the last two months designing an interactive and innovative curriculum for the CS Elective - Power of Algorithms for the SMASH program at Northeastern University. We spent the last two weeks with an incredible group of scholars exposing them to the power of existing and novel technology, encouraging them to be creative, ambitious entrepreneurs while inculcating the importance of ethics and conscious thinking to make them mindful developers. We equipped them with the awareness of the strength and implications of algorithmic design in today's tech-driven world and an understanding of its misuse which perpetuates social injustices and bias. It is of essence to speak of these increasingly prevalent issues to create a safer and more inclusive space for everyone in tech. We ended the elective on a bitter-sweet note knowing we'd miss every moment spent in the classroom with the scholars. This experience made me grow a deeper understanding of my role as a contributor to tech and was extremely valuable in comprehending how pivotal the youth are for the future of STEM.

I thank Professor Elena (Laney) Strange and Joseph Browne for providing us with this great opportunity and facilitating this program. Professor Strange is easily the best mentor any team could ask for! She helped shape all our big, bizarre ideas and visions into a solid elective and supported us every step of the way. We are extremely grateful for your confidence in us.
